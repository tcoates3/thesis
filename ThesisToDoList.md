1. **Overall**
   - Restructure chapters with "abstract" then main text
   - In-text citations

1. **Chapter 1**
   - Mathematics of SM and Higgs physics
   - top-Higgs Yukawa coupling (or in Chapter 5)
   - Diagrams of the collider complexes
   - Facts and figures of the colliders (e.g. luminosities, polarisation)
   - Summary table of the "vital statistics" of the different colliders

1. **Chapter 2**
   - Write summary

1. **Chapter 3**
   - Explanation of Fig 3.6 (DQM4hep monitoring interface)
   - Add correlation plots section, and results from May 2017 CERN testbeam

1. **Chapter 5**
   - Explanation of top-Higgs Yukawa coupling (or in Chapter 1)
   - Explanation of the derivation of the cross-section and its uncertainty
   - Explanation of the derivation of the coupling from the cross-section, and its uncertainty
   - More plots of the BDTs, other stuff, etc.
   - Explanation of the criteria for the BDTs
   - Overall just MORE detail, as much as possible
