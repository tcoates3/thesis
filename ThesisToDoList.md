**Comments I disagree with:**

- p.79 "while the W boson has all possible decay modes"
- p.79 "and provide [the W decay modes] in a table"
- p.85 "Jets?" regarding the equation and plots for R_0, which is a lepton selection variable
- p.88 "how are [the beam jets] identified? Clarify"
- p.88 "which [jet] properties? Clarify"
- p.88 "What about the s-tagging and c-tag efficiencies? [...] Clarify"
- p.88 "After flavour tagging is [...]" and "are completed"
- p.89 "How is the chi-squared used to select the candidates? Do you have a plot of chi-squared for the different [...]?"
