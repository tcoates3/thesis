# The Question(s)

>Is there a way we can use the same software over and over again for testbeams, while making the software equally useful for all people, easy to use and bind, and presentable?

>When the next-generation of lepton colliders are built, will their detectors be able to identify the presence of BSM physics in the Higgs sector by looking at ee->tth events?

# Master To Do List
1. **EUDAQ and DQM4HEP**
   - Continue writing the user's guide documentation
   - Implement more quality tests (especially Kolmogorov-Smirnov now that reference histograms are possible)
   - Try to implement fully-parameterised functionality for the mean/RMS tests
   - Somehow get access to the DESY dCache so I can download more testbeam data later on, especially for thesis work
3. **Physics Analysis, Processing**
   - Finish processing all runs through the analysis
   - Merge Treemaker results? There shouldn't be any reason not to merge continually but there's also no particular reason to do it either, since the .root files take up so little space compared to the .slcio files.
3. **Physics Analysis, Other**
   - Read papers about previous analyses of tth stuff
   - Try to find more information on how to quantify CP violation in tth events
4. **Papers and Literature**
   - Read papers about ILC/CLIC and tth analysis
   - Write conference proceedings for ACAT  (11th Nov)
5. **Miscellany**
   - Test out the Valencia algorithm on some of the tth stuff (if possible with this large sample size?)
