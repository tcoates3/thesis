# The Question(s)

>Is there a way we can use the same software for most testbeams, while making the software equally useful for all people, easy to use and bind, and presentable?

>When the next-generation of lepton colliders are built, will their detectors be able to identify the presence of BSM physics in the Higgs sector by looking at ee->tth events?

# Master To Do List
1. **EUDAQ and DQM4HEP**
   - Make a repo for the DREAM testbeam software
   - Start work on implementing the event streamer for (one of) the DREAM data types
   - Email back the dark matter person (?)
   - Assess the qtests by making plots of "goodness" against parameters to see how the "goodness" varies and whether it's useful
   - Implement the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
   - Continue writing the user's guide documentation
3. **Physics Analysis**
   - Look through the data that Jenny has sent
   - Start writing some code to try to do the jet charge determination, both at MC-level and reconstruction-level
   - Test out the Valencia algorithm on some of the tth stuff (if possible with this large sample size?)
4. **Thesis Writing**
   - [...]
6. **Miscellany**
   - *Call* Oliver about DESY password reset
   - Do paperwork for annual review
   - Send off expenses docs
