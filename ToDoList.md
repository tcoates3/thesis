# The Question(s)

>Is there a way we can use the same software for most testbeams, while making the software equally useful for all people, easy to use and bind, and presentable?

>When the next-generation of lepton colliders are built, will their detectors be able to identify the presence of BSM physics in the Higgs sector by looking at ee->tth events?

# Master To Do List
1. **EUDAQ and DQM4HEP**
   - Implement DREAM calorimeter module
   - Assess the qtests by making plots of "goodness" against parameters to see how the "goodness" varies and whether it's useful
   - Continue writing the user's guide documentation
   - Create an example repo (dqm4hep-custom?) that has basic CMake files, and highly-commented file readers, event streamers, and analysis modules to help people write their own plugins and modules.
3. **Physics Analysis**
   - Look through the data that Jenny has sent
   - Start writing some code to try to do the jet charge determination, both at MC-level and reconstruction-level
   - Test out the Valencia algorithm on some of the tth stuff (if possible with this large sample size?)
4. **Thesis Writing**
   - [...]
5. **Jobs**
   - DESY fellowship, CERN fellowship, ...?
   - Ask Fab, Katja, and one other person for recommendation letters for DESY and CERN fellowships.
   - Redo CV (and also check whether it has to be different from a regular CV)
6. **Miscellany**
   - *Call* Oliver about DESY password reset
   - Book flight and accommodation, and do insurance for the DREAM testbeam
   - Do required paperwork for getting a dosimeter for the DREAM testbeam
