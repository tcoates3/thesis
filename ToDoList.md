# The Question(s)

>Is there a way we can use the same software for most testbeams, while making the software equally useful for all people, easy to use and bind, and presentable?

>When the next-generation of lepton colliders are built, will their detectors be able to identify the presence of BSM physics in the Higgs sector by looking at ee->tth events?

# Master To Do List
1. **EUDAQ and DQM4HEP**
   - Assess the qtests by making plots of "goodness" against parameters to see how the "goodness" varies and whether it's useful.
   - Once Nicola has moved testbeam data where it's accessible, start working on the postmortem combined monitoring. (This will be good to show at a DREAM meeting.)
   - Write the sections for the qtests and DREAM testbeam in the CHEP proceedings.
   - Continue writing the user's guide documentation.
   - Create an example repo (dqm4hep-custom?) that has basic CMake files, and highly-commented file readers, event streamers, and analysis modules to help people write their own plugins and modules.
3. **Physics Analysis**
   - *Call* Oliver about DESY password reset.
   - Look through the data that Jenny has sent.
   - Start writing some code to try to do the jet charge determination, both at MC-level and reconstruction-level.
   - Test out the Valencia algorithm on some of the tth stuff (if possible with this large sample size?).
4. **Thesis Writing**
   - Start writing some proper parts for the monitoring chapter.
   - Talk with Fab about setting goals for chapters.
   - Decide on whether to do this thing with Jenny List for the analysis or not.
5. **Jobs**
   - Finish DESY fellowship application.
   - Ask Fab, Katja, and one other person for recommendation letters for DESY and CERN fellowships.
   - Redo CV (and also check whether it has to be different from a regular CV).
6. **Miscellany**
   - [...]
