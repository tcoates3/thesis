# The Question(s)

>Is there a way we can use the same software for most testbeams, while making the software equally useful for all people, easy to use and bind, and presentable?

>When the next-generation of lepton colliders are built, will their detectors be able to identify the presence of BSM physics in the Higgs sector by looking at ee->tth events?

# Master To Do List
1. **DQM4hep**
   - Create an example repo to help people write custom plugins and modules (include CMake files, highly-commented file readers, event streamers, and analysis modules)
   - Get Remi to upload the documentation
2. **Testbeam Analysis**
   - Make energy-to-ADC calibration, using the assumption that the calorimeter response is linear
   - Perform tower calibration, using the calibration electron runs
