I have already completed a first draft of chapter 3 and have completed the majority of the chapter 4 already. Chapter 5 is already begun, and in general will be more descriptive of analysis that has already been finished, rather than an in-depth account of an experiment like chapter 4. 

Chapters 1 and 7 have not been started, which is why they are alloted more time. Chapter 2 is similar, but will be a summary of linear collider projects and can be based on existing information and technical reports, so will be easier (and faster) to produce.
