\epigraph{What we know is really very, very little compared to what we still have to know.}{Fabiola Gianotti}

%It is often said that particle physics is something like trying to discern the exact mechanisms, inner workings, and design of a pocketwatch by firing it from a cannon at a wall, and sifting through the resulting debris. 

%Many of the results are pulverised brick, which provide no insight into the watch itself. Still more are the glimmers of metal, fragments of gems, twisted springs, and shards of glass that we can use to try to piece together the whole.

%From the potsherds dug from the dust, we gradually reassemble the pot itself.

%Given that the constructed \acrshort{CLIC} can perform this measurement with a significantly lower uncertainty using only a tenth of the centre of mass energy and an integrated luminosity seven orders of magnitude lower, is a perfect demonstration of the physics case for a lepton collider at the energy frontier.
