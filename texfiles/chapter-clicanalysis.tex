One of the primary goals of future lepton colliders is to become ``Higgs factories'' -- machines that can produce large numbers of Higgs bosons in a variety of final states, allowing the Higgs sector of the \acrlong{SM} to be probed with unprecedented accuracy and coverage.

One of the best way to examine the Higgs sector is via the production of Higgs bosons in association with top quarks. The coupling between these two particles -- the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling -- is the strongest Higgs coupling of all, making it one of the easiest ways to examine the properties of the Higgs and its couplings. 

An important process used to study the coupling between the Higgs and the top is the so-called $tth$ process:
$$
e^+ e^- \rightarrow t\overline{t}h
$$

The production of two top quarks in association with a Higgs makes this an ideal probe for this coupling. However, the decay channels of this process vary -- each top quark can decay in one of two ways. It can decay \textit{hadronically} into a quark-antiquark pair, where one quark is up-type and the other is down-type; or it can decay \textit{leptonically} into a lepton of the same charge as the W and a neutrino of the same flavour, with one being an antiparticle (e.g. $e^- \overline{\nu}_e$ or $\mu^+ \nu_\mu$). The total branching ratio of hadronic decays is 67.60 $\pm$ 0.27\%, and the total branching ratio of the leptonic decays is 10.90 $\pm$ 0.09\%. The decay processes of the W are: % Ref for BRs: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2013/listings/rpp2013-list-w-boson.pdf
$$
W^+ \rightarrow q\overline{q}
$$
$$
W^+ \rightarrow \ell^+ \nu
$$
$$
W^- \rightarrow q\overline{q}
$$
$$
W^- \rightarrow  \ell^- \nu
$$

where $q\overline{q}$ denotes the quark-antiquark pair and $\ell \nu$ denotes the lepton-neutrino pair. Thus there are three possible final states:
$$
e^+ e^- \rightarrow t\overline{t}h \rightarrow q\overline{q}q\overline{q}b\overline{b}
$$
$$
e^+ e^- \rightarrow t\overline{t}h \rightarrow \ell \nu \ell \nu b \overline{b}
$$
$$
e^+ e^- \rightarrow t\overline{t}h \rightarrow \ell \nu q \overline{q} b \overline{b}
$$

The upshot of this is that in order to perform accurate analysis of this process, jet energy resolution and jet reconstruction is of primary importance, as the majority of the decays will be via the hadronic channel. As discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:colliders}, the detector designs for future lepton colliders are designed to focus on jet energy resolution and jet reconstruction, and utilise particle flow to augment this.

This chapter describes an analysis performed to attain a precision on the measurement of the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling at the \acrfull{CLIC} experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 1.4TeV$, using the CLIC\textunderscore SiD detector concept. This analysis focuses specifically on the hadronic channel, and when taken in combination with a similar analysis of the semi-leptonic channel performed by Yixuan Zhang\refthis allows calculation of the precision on the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling.

The $tth$ event has three possible final states, defined by the decay channel of the W bosons produced by the top quarks. The decay of a top quark will always produce a W boson and a bottom quark, while the W boson can decay one of two ways. Since \textit{which} W produces certain decay products does not matter, there are three possible combinations that can be seen in Table \ref{table:physics/final-states}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
	\hline \hline
	Decay Channel & Final State & Branching Ratio \\ \hline \hline
	Fully hadronic & $q\overline{q}q\overline{q}b\overline{b}$ & 45.70\% \\ \hline
	Semi-hadronic &  $\ell \nu q\overline{q}b\overline{b}$ & 7.36\% \\ \hline \hline
	Fully leptonic & $\ell \nu \ell \nu b\overline{b}$ & 1.18\% \\ \hline 
	\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Due to the branching ratio, the hadronic final state is far more common, and the leptonic state is the rarest. Analysis of the leptonic state is made difficult by the presence of two charged leptons in the final state, confusing the identification of the W bosons. Given this and it's very low branching ratio, the leptonic final state is not used in this analysis. Extended Feynman diagrams of the fully hadronic and semi-leptonic final states are shown in Figs. \ref{figure:physics/SM/feynman-tth-hadronic} and \ref{figure:physics/SM/feynman-tth-semileptonic}

\section{Physics generation and samples}
The Monte Carlo samples were generated predominantly using Whizard 1.95, though for the Higgs events, Physsim was used due to technical constraints of Whizard [ref?]. All samples were simulated at $\sqrt{s} = 1.4TeV$ using unpolarised beams, assuming an integrated luminosity of 1.5 ab\textsuperscript{-1} and a light \acrlong{SM} Higgs boson with mass of 125 GeV. See Table \ref{table:physics/SM/generatedsamples} for a summary of all of the used samples. The first two rows are the tth signal channels, all other rows are backgrounds. The number of jets refers to the number of jets in the final state that have come from the decay of the top quark pair. The number of events in 1.5 ab\textsuperscript{-1} has been calculated from the integrated luminosity and sample weight.

\section{Detector models}
[...]

[...] henceforth referred to as CLIC\textunderscore SiD.

\section{Analysis method}
The first and most important step off the analysis is to determine which jets originate from the Higgs boson, [...] The invariant mass of the Higgs boson can be determined by summing the invariant masses of pairs of bottom quarks and computing the $\chi^2$ for each possible combination; the combination with the lowest $\chi^2$ shows the pair that has decayed from the Higgs boson. [...]

\begin{equation}
  \centering
	\chi^2 = \frac{(m_{ij} - m_W)^2}{\sigma^2_W} + \frac{(m_{ijk} - m_t)^2}{\sigma^2_{t_1}} + \frac{(m_{ijk} - m_t)^2}{\sigma^2_{t_2}} + \frac{(m_{lm} - m_H)^2}{\sigma^2_H}
\end{equation}

A similar equation is used for the semi-leptonic channel, removing one of the terms for the top quark mass.

\subsection{Sample processing}
The first step of processing the samples is the initial jet clustering. This is done using the $k_t$ algorithm with parameters [?], using an exclusive clustering mode to form 8 jets -- 6 jets from the produced quarks and 2 beam jets. The $k_t$ algorithm is used over choices like anti-$k_t$ and Valencia, because the important features are the \emph{relative} shapes of the jets, rather than absolute properties, so there is no need to use more computationally-intensive [is this true?] algorithms.

Once initial jet clustering is finished, a Marlin processor that finds isolated leptons is used. It searches for either 0, 1, or 2 isolated leptons, and this information can be used to make decisions about whether to process the event already:

\begin{table}[htp]
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ | c | l | l | }
	\hline
	Leptons & Channel & Action \\ \hline
	0 & Fully hadronic & Use for fully hadronic analysis \\ \hline
	1 & Semi-leptonic & Use for semi-leptonic analysis \\ \hline
	2 & Fully leptonic & Discard \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Following this, the two beam jets are removed from the processing, and a further step of jet re-clustering is performed, using the Durham algorithm, to [...] [Why is this done? Why Durham?]

[...] [Flavour tagging]

[...] [Tau finding]

The final step is to use use PandoraPFAs to generate \acrlong{PFO}s (\acrshort{PFO}s) of the undetectable particles, especially the top quarks, $W^\pm$, and Higgs. [...]

\subsection{Analysis processing}
Once the sample has been processed, it must be analysed. The first step of this is a program used to extract various kinematic variables of both particles in the events ($m_0$, $p_t$) and the event itself ($\Psi$, $T$). This is the Treemaker program, and [...] [Chi-squared extraction of invariant masses] [Feeding into \acrshort{TMVA} to generate \acrshort{BDT}s]

%A flow diagram of the analysis process, and the rejection points, is shown in Fig. \ref{figure:physics/SM/CLIC-analysis-algorithm}.

% The flow diagram below is of questionable usefulness. Maybe add an extra rejection stage at the reconstruction step (if the chi-squared of the Higgs invariant mass is bad, this indicates an event with no Higgs which should be discarded.

% Consider also folding the diagram a bit; we can run horizontally from start to lepton decision, then downwards but dog-legging the boxes. This will make the diagram a little bit more compact, though maybe at the expense of immediate readability.

\section{Results}
[...] 

The combined uncertainty for the cross-section of both decay channels is:

Cross-section: $$\Delta\sigma = 7.30\% $$

Then using this and a linear approximation from \acrshort{QCD} [ref], the value of the uncertainty on the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling can be computed:

$$\frac{\Delta g_{tth}}{g_{tth}} = 0.503 \frac{\Delta\sigma(t\overline{t}H)}{\sigma(t\overline{t}H)} = 3.86\% $$

These results were contributed to a paper that summarised the top physics potential for \acrshort{CLIC} at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.4 TeV, published in [journal][ref] and will be submitted to CERN's European Strategy Update in 2019 [ref].

%\section{Determination of sensitivity to CP-violation}
%[...]

%Another important avenue to pursue is \acrshort{CP}-violation in the Higgs sector. Since Higgs physics is still an emerging field, it is not yet known whether \acrshort{CP}-violation is present in the Higgs sector to the degree that the \acrlong{SM} predicts. It is also a fertile area for investigation of \acrshort{BSM} physics, as many \acrshort{BSM} models predict additional Higgs bosons, or Higgs bosons with characteristics that differ from the \acrshort{SM} Higgs.

%The $e^+ e^- \rightarrow t\overline{t}h$ event (see Fig. \ref{figure:physics/SM/feynman-tth}) is one process that is both accessible to \acrshort{CLIC}'s design energy and extremely useful for interrogating the Higgs sector for \acrshort{CP}-violation and \acrshort{BSM} physics. The production of Higgs bosons allows for several observables that would be sensitive to any Higgs bosons with an odd \acrshort{CP} quantum number (or ``CP-odd'' Higgs bosons). Determining the detectors' sensitivity to the ratio of \acrshort{CP}-odd and \acrshort{CP}-even Higgs bosons (also called the \acrshort{CP} mixing angle) will allow further understanding of the limits of the Standard Model, as well as the limits on the various \acrshort{BSM} physics models, and regions of interest for possible new physics.


%\subsection{CP-sensitive observables}
%[...]

%\subsubsection{Up-down asymmetry}
%The up-down asymmetry is a conceptually simple observable that has already been identified for investigating \acrshort{CP}-violation in the tth process. It is found by defining a plane from the vectors of the incoming electron and produced antitop, then finding the ratio of top quarks that are emitted above and below this plane (see Fig. \ref{figure:physics/SM/up-down}). If there is no \acrshort{CP}-violation in this process, the ratio will be even.
%
%Using the up-down asymmetry as an observable requires that the $W^+$ and $W^-$ can be distinguished from each other, and has thus far only been used for the semi-leptonic decay channel. In this case, the lepton produced by the decay of one of the W bosons identifies its charge, and thus the charge of the top quark that it has decayed from. While this method was not previously possible in the fully hadronic case, a method for applying it by using jet charge determination is discussed in Section \ref{section:physics/CP/jetcharge}.

%\subsubsection{[other ones]}
%[...]
%
%\subsection{Jet charge determination} \label{section:physics/CP/jetcharge}
%Previous analyses that have utilised the up-down asymmetry as an observable have focused exclusively on the semi-leptonic decay channel of tth events, as the presence of a lepton emitted by the top or antitop quark offers a simple and statistically robust method to distinguish between the two top quarks. In the hadronic decay channel each top emits a jet, and even in the ideal case where each particle resulting from the jet can be accurately reconstructed, the net charge will \emph{still} be an integer, since no particles with a non-integer charge can result from these decays.
%
%However, techniques developed in recent years, intended primarily for observations in \acrshort{ATLAS} at the \acrshort{LHC}, have refined methods for this, and using the work of [reference], it is now possible to obtain the total net charge of the jet -- that is, the charge of the initial quark that creates the jet. 
%
%This technique is strongly-dependent upon the accuracy and efficiency of both particle reconstruction and jet clustering, but these techniques are constantly improving, and \acrfull{PandoraPFA} and new jet clustering methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Combined with the cleaner final states in a lepton collider, these techniques allow the charge of a jet to be determined with useful confidence.
%
%The charge of a jet can be determined by summing the charges of all particles in the jet, weighted by $p_T$ and normalised by the $p_T$ of the entire jet:
%		
%\begin{displaymath}
%	\mathcal{Q}_\kappa^i = \frac{1}{(p_T^{jet})^\kappa} \sum_{j \in jet} Q_j (p_T^j)^\kappa
%\end{displaymath}
%
%Where $\kappa$ is some parameter between 0 and 1, typically set to 1. With this technique, it is possible to determine between quarks with charges of $+1/3e$, $-1/3e$, $+2/3e$, and $-2/3e$ with [some level of confidence].
%
%\subsubsection{Jet clustering algorithms}
%Since this method relies upon jets it is strongly dependent upon jet reconstruction, and thus on the choice of jet clustering algorithm and parameters. Previous analyses of tth events have used a two-step reclustering approach, using the $k_t$ algorithm for the initial clustering and the Durham algorithm for reclustering. These algorithms were chosen as the relative difference between the jet shapes is more important than their absolute shapes, so other algorithms do not provide any benefits.
%
%The Valencia algorithm, however, gives improved performance in the cleaner final states of a lepton collider, for which it was especially designed, and many analyses are now transitioning to using the Valencia algorithm.
