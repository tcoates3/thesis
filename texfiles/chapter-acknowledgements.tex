% Academic
I'd first like to thank my supervisor Fabrizio Salvatore, for being exactly as hands-on and hands-off as I needed, when I needed it, and without whose help and guidance I wouldn't have been able to do this. Thanks to all of the \emph{Forschung mit Lepton Collidern} group at DESY in Hamburg for [...] but especially to Katja Kr\"{u}ger, Adrian Irles-Quiles (now at LAL Orsay), and R\'{e}mi Et\'{e}.

% Personal
I'd like to thank my highschool physics teachers Mr Coombes and Mr Thomas, who both nurtured my early love for physics (and I'll also take this opportunity to apologise for never doing my homework). [...] 

% Funding
I would like to thank the UK's Science and Technology Funding Council for gratiously providing enough money to prevent me from either starving or being evicted while performing this research. Thanks also to Linear Collider UK for providing vital funding for travel and a community for linear collider researchers when the UK science bodies were not fully committed to funding linear collider research and no-one was sure whether either the ILC or CLIC would ever be built.

% AIDA-2020
I would also like to thank the whole AIDA-2020 collaboration for [...] and always scheduling their annual meetings in sunny countries with good food. Special thanks to David Cussans and Matthew Wing for their leadership and organisation of the activities within Work Package 5.


Similarly, I would like to thank all of the organisers of the Beam Telescopes and Test Beams workshop for providing a forum for researchers to discuss our work and learn from each other, as well as organising their meetings in lovely cities with wonderful food.
