The combined testbeam comprised four separate dectors: a calorimeter, a muon detector and preshower, a drift chamber, and a silicon photomultiplier. [...]

Importantly, none of these detectors or the teams responsible for their construction and operation were part of AIDA-2020, which was useful as a testbed for the generic nature of the DQM4hep framework - previous testbeams had only used AIDA-2020 detectors, many of which used filetypes or structures defined within the collaboration. By attempting to use DQM4hep to monitor non-AIDA-2020, it was possible to test that the design of the framework was truly generic and adaptable to any kind of detector with any filetype.
